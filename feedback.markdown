We want to hear your feedback on  HOT, whoever you are. Please feel free to write in the language you feel most comfortable with to let us know what you think about any aspect of HOT's work using either the form or the email address.

We will respond to your feedback if you have indicated that you would like a response. All feedback will be forwarded to the relevant team within HOT, and discussed, and we will respond as soon as possible if appropriate.

We will use your feedback to continuously improve HOT's work, whether that applies to technology, communications, community engagement, recruitment, or something else. Sometimes the subject of feedback will be discussed in open working groups or in other online forums, but will never include personally identifiable information unless the person has given us explicit consent to do so.

If you have a general inquiry that is not related to HOT's activities, please use the [contact page](https://www.hotosm.org/contact).
