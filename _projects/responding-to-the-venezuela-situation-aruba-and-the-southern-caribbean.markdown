HOT finished a two-month project in partnership with UNHCR on the Venezuela migration/refugee situation and impact in the Caribbean (specifically Aruba). This included updates to POI data throughout Aruba and a profiling survey of Venezuelans living in Aruba.

The escalation of violence and deteriorating economic conditions in Venezuela have led to a large outflow of Venezuelans into Aruba and other Southern Caribbean countries. The influx received is characterized by increasingly complex mixed population movements that involves asylum-seekers, migrants, refugees, victims of human trafficking, smuggling, along with other categories of vulnerable persons of concerns. As the crisis in Venezuela worsens, the number of asylum applications by citizens of that country has soared. However, these figures represent only a fraction of the total number of Venezuelans who may be in need of international protection, as many do not or cannot register as asylum seekers.

HOT provided assistance to UNHCR in order to to asses the conditions, population, and needs of Venezuelans in Aruba. This project enhances UNHCRâ€™s ability to offer targeted and principled assistance to the most vulnerable and those in need of protection across the island.
