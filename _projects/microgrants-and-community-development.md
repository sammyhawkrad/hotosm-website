OpenStreetMap community leaders around the world are achieving amazing results on zero or near-zero budgets. Many have a desire or an opportunity to grow their projects mapping their local communities, cities, and countries, but lack the basics to be able to do so. HOT supports these communities through Microgrants and Device Grants, which cover costs for internet access, devices, training, and field activities. Our aim is to support and strengthen local OpenStreetMap communities through providing these basics to key leaders who are transforming their communities through mapping.
