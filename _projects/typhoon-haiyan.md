<p>We activated to provide geographic base data in areas affected by typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan in the Philippines, coordinating on the <a href="http://wiki.osm.org/Typhoon_Haiyan">Typhoon_Haiyan</a> wiki page. Our maps have been used on the ground by aid agencies, including <a href="http://www.redcross.org/what-we-do/international-services">American Red Cross</a>who equip their teams with OpenStreetMap maps. Tying in with this, the British Red Cross have been working to help improve our map coverage</p><p><a href="http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013-contributors">Hundreds of contributors</a> have joined our effort by editing OpenStreetMap to make improvements in the Philippines. These projects are complete, visit tasks.hotosm for other humanitarian mapping.</p><p>As always, you can use these HOT resources:</p><ul><li><a href="http://learnosm.org">learnosm.org</a> - helps you learn how to edit OpenStreetMap.</li><li><a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org">tasks.hotosm.org</a> - lets you coordinate with other mappers around the world, to pick an area to work on.</li></ul>
