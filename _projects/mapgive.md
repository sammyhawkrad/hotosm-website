<p>HOT supported the launch of MapGive in March 2014. MapGive is a project of the Humanitarian Information Unit in the State Department of the United States.</p><p>From the website:</p><p><em>Quality geographic data helps empower organizations and communities to make important decisions across a range of environmental, economic and crisis management themes. For many places in the world, this information is incomplete or does not exist at all. Digital humanitarians map online to help give others the data they need to build a more sustainable future.</em></p><p>Head over to the MapGive website to learn more: <a href="http://mapgive.state.gov">http://mapgive.state.gov</a></p>
