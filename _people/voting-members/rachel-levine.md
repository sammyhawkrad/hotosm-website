I joined HOT as a voting member in 2017 but I was introduced to the wonderful world of HOT in 2012 at what might have been the first ever American Red Cross mapathon. It was love at first sight.

Skip ahead 5 years, add a master’s degree that focused on participatory geography, and I now work at the American Red Cross on the GIS team and engage with HOT on a daily basis. I'm super involved in planning mapathons both here in the US and globally and I'm really excited to engage further with the community!
