HOT has long been one of my favourite initiatives: global and local, online and on the ground, digital and human, collaborative, open and humanitarian. I’m proud to be a voting member and a mapper.

By trade I am a consultant and advisor. I’m developing and building a global community around a simple philosophy called Sentientism that commits to using evidence (including maps!) and reason and has compassion for all sentient beings (mainly human and non-human animals). You can find out more about it here: https://sentientism.info/ and join our main community here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/sentientism.

You can find me on Twitter [@jamiewoodhouse](https://twitter.com/@jamiewoodhouse) and [@sentientism](https://twitter.com/@sentientism).
