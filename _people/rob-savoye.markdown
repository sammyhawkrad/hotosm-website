Rob lives on an old mining claim way up in the Colorado Rockies at 2800M. As a long time climber/skier and rural volunteer fire-fighter, Rob knows the importance of good maps. Hacking custom maps for a Garmin decades ago eventually led to being an active OpenStreetMap contributor and mapping software developer. He's personally experienced how important accurate maps are for emergency response and recreational purposes.

Rob has been a free software developer since the late 1980s, with multiple projects still in use decades later. As a long-time believer in appropriate technology and community, Rob has been heavily involved in multiple high-profile free software projects like the GNU Toolchain, GNU/Linux, Gnash, and was an early pioneer in the creation of the commercial internet. He's won awards from both NASA, and the Free Software Foundation.
