She supported the set up of ‘[Innovation as a Service](https://medium.com/innovationhub-planinternational/setting-up-innovation-as-a-service-within-a-large-international-ngo-153637b0d7c9)’ and worked together with teams around the world to develop new products, services and initiatives for social impact, driven by girls’ and young women’s needs. Her thematic experience ranges from youth education and entrepreneurship, to malnutrition and gender empowerment. She has worked with teams in Latin America, West Africa, South East Asia and Europe. Carly has also worked in digital consulting in the public sector and led on building new cross-sector partnerships for a Corporate Social Responsibility programme. As a volunteer, Carly led a [multi-client ‘mapathon’](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-digital-put-over-48000-people-map-just-4-days-carly-redhead/) to engage volunteers across the UK in the Missing Maps project and trained colleagues to lead their own events.
