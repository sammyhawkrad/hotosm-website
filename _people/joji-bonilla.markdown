Joji is the Community and Volunteer Manager of HOT Philippines, bringing years of experience working with both local and international volunteers. She was a trainer and facilitator for the US Peace Corps (USPC), managed the delivery of projects to communities in the Cordillera Region with Plan International, and supervised volunteers of Volunteer Service Overseas (VSO) from North and South America, Africa, and Europe.

She has also trained Forest Guards in Mindanao in the early days of the Agroforestry program of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. IN 2004, she was also a consultant for the Cordillera Technical Working Group in developing and planning their Provincial Millennium Development Goals. Apart from her work in the community with volunteers, she led the development of the Gender and Development and the Disability Program for both VSO Philippines and Indonesia. These programs were designed by the stakeholders identified needs and together with the technically skilled volunteers, were implemented on the ground.

Joji graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of the Philippines Cebu. She is excited to work with current and future partners, stakeholders, and volunteers to be “part of the community that is helping map the world.”
