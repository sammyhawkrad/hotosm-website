Jikka Defiño is currently the Communications Associate of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team - Philippines. Immersed in various media platforms, she has spent over six years joining the dots between culture, storytelling, and social literacy.

She previously worked in advertising, managing award-winning marketing communications campaigns for real estate and FMCG brands. She also dabbled in publishing as a features writer and editor, adapting press articles, writing pop culture and state of the nation essays, and editing branded content for the top digital lifestyle publisher in the Philippines. Since her stint in brand-driven advertising and journalism, Jikka is now determined to shift the focus of her communications work towards solutions-based journalism, where she can help amplify stories of positive change through profiling stories and community features.
