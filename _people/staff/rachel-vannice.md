Rachel joined HOT in 2016 with a Bachelors from Boston University in International Relations and a Masters in International Development from Trinity College Dublin. After working with the Peace Corps in Rwanda and with several national and international NGOs, she was still new to mapping. Since then, she's been amazed and remains excited at the potential for mapping to impact development work and humanitarian action across sectors. Rachel works across the organization coordinating training and legal support; is leading HOT's Gender, Diversity & Inclusion (GDI) initiatives; and supporting organizational development.
