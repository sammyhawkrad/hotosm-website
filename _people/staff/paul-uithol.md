Director of Humanitarian Data with Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. I manage HOT’s field programs and country teams globally. This includes data collection & mapping programs with key government, NGO and private sector partners across sectors such as disaster and refugee response, urban planning, health emergencies, and disaster risk management.

I've worked with HOT since early 2015, originally managing mapping projects such as "Ramani Huria" in Tanzania, and have continued supporting the growth and expansion of our communities and projects across the world. I immensely enjoy the combination of the educational aspects, local skills and capacity building, and supporting (local) governments and NGOs to incorporate open geospatial data into their thinking, policy and decision making across a wide range of sectors and use cases.

This means promoting and improving the availability and applicability of open maps and data everywhere - by working with our country teams (with a mix of international and local staff), the establishment of operations in new countries, overseeing field operations & implementation, development of curricula and mapping methodology, and stakeholder workshops and trainings.
 
I've been involved in digital mapping and cartography since the early 2000's, and have a wealth of experience in open data, open mapping & OpenStreetMap, participatory mapping, location-based services and GIS (Geographical Information Systems), combined with excellent technical ability and organizational and management skills. I've worked and led projects in Aruba, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Liberia, Mali, the Philippines, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda, and Zambia.
