Dinar is one of four Data Quality Assurances for Indonesia Road Mapping project. He is responsible for reviewing and improving the quality of data input. Before joining HOT Indonesia in October 2016, I was involved as a GIS research assistant funded by Seameo Biotrop and I also worked as field surveyors. I was graduated from the Department of Forest Resources Conservation and Ecotourism from the Faculty of Forestry, Bogor Agricultural University with a focus on environmental spatial analysis. I have always loved the anjangsana, planted fruit trees, and outdoor scientific activities.
