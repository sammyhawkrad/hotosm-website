Over 200 students at 13 universities participated in the second round of the YouthMappers ‘Mapping to end Malaria’ Challenge. Together, they mapped almost 400,000 buildings in Zimbabwe. Thank you to all the chapters who participated!

![UCC YM.jpg](https://cdn.hotosm.org/website/UCC+YM.jpg)We’re pleased to announce, the winners of this round are:

1. **UCC YouthMappers from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana**: Another incredible effort from UCC YouthMappers, at nearly 4,000 buildings per mapper! Their team has added more than 200,000 buildings during the campaign so far.

2. **PoliMappers from Politecnico di Milano, Italy**: one of the smaller chapters in the competition, PoliMappers put themselves solidly into second place, mapping an average of over 600 buildings per mapper.

3. **CalU GIS Club at California University of Pennsylvania, USA**: a handful of chapters came in with several hundred buildings per mapper but the CalU GIS Club came out in front of the pack.

Our congratulations and thanks go to all the YouthMappers who participated. By way of thanks for their contributions, first and second place will receive financial support from HOT for items they need to grow their mapping community, such as equipment and mapathon costs. Third place will receive a HOT Thank You pack for their team, with some HOT stash.

We have one more round of the competition and there is plenty of time for your YouthMappers chapter to join in, and be in with a chance to win prizes!
