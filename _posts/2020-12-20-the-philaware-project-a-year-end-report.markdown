2020 has been an impactful year for HOT Philippines as the country team’s flagship project, PhilAWARE, achieved milestones for its pilot areas amidst the pandemic. Launched in July 2019, the PhilAWARE project is a localized version of DisasterAWARE, funded by the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and supported by the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).

### HOT Philippines' Role in the PhilAWARE Project

Initially, the HOT Philippines team was tasked to map two pilot areas: the Province of Pampanga, and Quezon City in Metro Manila. This year, remote mapping for both areas were completed, and a new pilot area for remote mapping was added: Marikina City in Metro Manila. Remote mapping and validation activities for Pampanga and Quezon City were completed with the help of volunteers, organizations, partners, and other stakeholders while Marikina City is still in progress.

Aside from the remote mapping activities, the HOT Philippines mapping team also began collecting **[critical lifeline infrastructure data ](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PhilAWARE_Data_Model)**from the ground in the municipalities in Pampanga. Field operations were made possible through the support of the local government offices and volunteers in Pampanga despite the restrictions of COVID-19.
