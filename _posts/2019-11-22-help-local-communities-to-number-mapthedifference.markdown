HOTâ€™s annual fundraising campaign supports communities with Microgrants to put themselves on the map, so they can address the challenges affecting them, from seasonal flooding and wildfires, to preventing gender-based violence, and responding to disease outbreaks.

In the past three years, HOT's fundraising campaign has supported 24 communities across 22 countries with over US$100,000. By donating, you will provide these communities with the technology, training and equipment they need to make sure no one is left behind.
