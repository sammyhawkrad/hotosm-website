In mid-September, we applied to HOT’s community development microgrant, and HOT, appreciating our efforts so far, included us in the program. Our project’s aim is to add Turkish language support to OpenStreetMap related tools, to translate the existing OpenStreetMap documents into Turkish and to expand the infrastructure of Yer Çizenler’s volunteer base while considering gender equality and community diversity.

Our active volunteer team, consisting of 8 female university students provided Turkish language support to the HOT’s Tasking Manager and has been sharing the Turkish edition of the weekly OpenStreetMap newsletter called WeeklyOSM for nearly a year. After starting the documentation process, Youth Season Association, which aims to promote the mobility of young people, intercultural dialogue and non-formal education, started a project with similar goals called Open Source Volunteering and we decided to execute the program together. In this way, we have greatly increased the number of active participation in the program.
