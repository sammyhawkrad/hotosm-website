The Humanitarian OpenSteetMap Team (HOT) has activated to provide geographic base data in areas affected by Hurricane Matthew. Category 4 Hurricane Matthew continues to strengthen and is advancing on Haiti and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew is expected to cause '[catastrophic](https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-matthew-caribbean-haiti-jamaica-cuba-bahamas-forecast-oct2)' damage including extreme flooding and landslides potentially affecting millions in Haiti, Jamaica, and Bahamas.

To start we are mapping coastal communities in the expected storm path.
