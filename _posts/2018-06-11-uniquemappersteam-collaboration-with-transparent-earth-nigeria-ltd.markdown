A drafted Memorandum of Understanding between Transparent Earth Nigeria Ltd. and the UniqueMappersTeam was sent to the company before UMT’s visit. This visit was an official platform to negotiate on the content of the MOU draft to strengthen the already existing local partnership between the two parties. It was as successful meeting and there was a positive response from Transparent Earth to accept UMT members as interns, field data collection surveyors and technical assistants.

A major feat of the day’s deliberation was the announcement of an employment opportunity for our Director of LetGirlsMap, who currently works with Transparent Earth as a graduate trainee. Further to this, the company also agreed to provide a funded award, the Annual Best Mappers Prize Award, to the best mapper from UniqueMappersTeam. Under the MoU, Transparent Earth Nigeria Ltd will continue to build relationships with the UniqueMappersTeam as local partners for mutual benefits. The Managing Director, Dr. C.L.Eze proudly declared himself as a UniqueMapper and requested members of his staff to join this action to promote the use of humanitarian mapping using OpenStreetMap.

This event was a very educational, fun and exciting moment for both parties. UMT looks forward to greater collaborations with Transparent Earth to facilitate effective humanitarian mapping in Nigeria and beyond, especially as UMT commences its HOT Microgrant project supporting communities vulnerable to flooding and oils spill disasters in Rivers State,Nigeria.
