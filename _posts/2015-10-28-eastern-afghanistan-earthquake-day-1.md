Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) calls upon our community to assist those affected by disaster for the second time in under one week

With sadness, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has called upon our community to assist those affected by disaster for the second time in under one week. Although every incident is unique, they all rely on the generosity of the contributors to give their time and effort and we are extremely grateful to have a community who choose to do so; thank you!

On Monday, October 26th an [earthquake struck](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/massive-earthquake-shakes-south-asia-151026092313888.html) the region near the Afghanistan and Pakistan border. HOT coordinators began evaluating the situation immediately, and by the end of the day had created several mapping projects in areas estimated to be heavily impacted. As this is a relatively remote and mountainous region, it may take many days for the governments and response agencies to assess the damage. It is also a very large area, and we want to do our best to ensure that the mapping we ask of the community will be of the most benefit.

Therefore we are currently working on the road network and populated place identification through this mapping project: [http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1264](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1264)

Here is a look at the first day's progress:
