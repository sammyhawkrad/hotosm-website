Welcome to the new Google Summer of Code and Outreachy students! The HOT Community is getting a significant amount of support this summer on our open source tools. Through the generous efforts of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) programs and sponsorship by the [DIAL Open Source Center](http://www.osc.dial.community/), we have four new students and interns working with HOT and our partner organizations. [OpenAerialMap](https://openaerialmap.org/), [Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/), [MapCampaigner](http://campaigns.hotosm.org/all), and the upcoming new HOT website will be the focus this summer. 

## Who’s working with us this summer?

From May to August, we will have four projects happening. Kartoza and many mentors from within the HOT community are helping to support these projects.

* **Ankita Khurana**, Google Summer of Code, working on OAM API. Mentor: Sean Harkins, HOT
* **Surya Saini**, Google Summer of Code, working on MapCampaigner. Mentor: Tim Sutton, Kartoza
* **Sunidhi Raheja**, Outreachy, working on Tasking Manager API. Mentor: Dakota Benjamin & Ethan Nelson, HOT
* **Ramya Ragupathy**, Outreachy, working on OSM data portals and website maps. Mentor: Nate, HOT

You’ll be able to track and see the final project outlines [via Github](https://github.com/hotosm/tech/issues/114).

## Why we participate in these programs?

Programs like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code give students and other groups that are underrepresented in tech a chance to connect with organizations working on open source tools. The Outreachy internship is open to women (cis or trans), trans men, and genderqueer people internationally, as well as, to underrepresented groups in the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. You can find out more about the program at [outreachy.org](https://www.outreachy.org/). The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program focuses on university students, giving them a chance to connect with open source projects during their summer break. 

We participate in these programs to work with motivated individuals and give them a chance to connect with the work of the HOT community. We want to see a diverse community of volunteers and community members participating in all of HOT’s work. 

## What’s next?

Over the next couple of weeks we will be finalizing the scope of each project, having them introduce themselves to the wider HOT community, and get ready to start working over the summer 2018. By the end of May, each individual will be working with their mentor and contributing to the tools.

Please welcome them with me and say hello! If you’re curious to get involved with their work, reach out to us on [Slack](http://slack.hotosm.org/) or get in touch with me at nate@hotosm.org.
