So, over at HOT_tech we’ve we’ve been working hard, so you can work easy. Our number one priority is hearing from you, so we’ve made some changes to make it easy for you to connect with us to notify us of bugs, issues and support requests.

All roads lead to…'hot_tech_requests'  .

We know that everyone likes to communicate in different ways; slack, email, online forms etc and we don’t want to change this. We want to meet you where you are. However, we also want to make sure that no request is left behind. As such, we have established a service desk that brings your request from where you are, to where we are - the hot_tech_requests desk.

So how does it work?

1. You send us a message however you want.

2. That message gets added to our service desk backlog (and you get a nice message to say ‘thanks’)

3. We work to resolve it

4. You get updates on how it’s progressing and when it’s done.

Raise your voice by raising a ticket and make sure that your voice gets heard and your ticket attended to.

So how do I do it?

Well, glad you asked, I was just about to mention. Everything can be done in three steps or less.
